# Simon-says

A React Native mobile application version of the game Simon says (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLi1qnRmpe4).

The app contains one screen that includes:
- Four colored playing buttons.
- Start button.
- Current score (the current length of the active sequence).

Some behavioural specifications:
- The sequence from Simon will be totally random.
- The sequence from Simon will increase by 1 for every successful try.
- If the player fails the game will stop until the user press start again.
